Today's JavaScript task was to add slide-in animation effects on scroll. As you might already know, scroll events can fire at high rate. If you want to see it in action, add counter in console for it:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("scroll", () => console.count("event"));
```

Therefore, it's advised to throttle the scroll event.
Luckily, Wes has already added debounce function. The final solution:

```javascript
const sliderImages = document.querySelectorAll(".slide-in");

function checkSlide() {
  sliderImages.forEach((sliderImage) => {
    // half way through the image
    const slideInAt = window.scrollY + window.innerHeight - sliderImage.height / 2;
    // bottom of the image
    const imageBottom = sliderImage.offsetTop + sliderImage.height;
    const isHalfShown = slideInAt > sliderImage.offsetTop;
    const isNotScrolledPast = window.scrollY < imageBottom;
    if (isHalfShown && isNotScrolledPast) {
      sliderImage.classList.add("active");
    } else {
      sliderImage.classList.remove("active");
    }
  });
}

window.addEventListener("scroll", debounce(checkSlide));
```

`active` class gets toggled, depending on calculations that determine image's position on the page.
The effect has been achieved, but sometimes when you scroll quickly there will be a bit of delay..
Can we improve this?

## A side story

A week ago Epic Web Conference took place in Park City, Utah. No, I didn't go there in person, that would be a loong trip from Latvia. However, they streamed it on YouTube, so I was able to watch it.
There were some great talks! One that especially caught my attention was Una Kravet's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/live/Q0fwzlwTLWk?si=pfHDS2wrsX4gOapK&t=3680) on CSS & HTML.
One of the topics - Scroll-driven animations. I mean those look really neat! Check [scroll-driven-aminations.style](https://scroll-driven-animations.style/) for some demos and examples.

## CSS animations on scroll

Back to today's task, when I saw the expected outcome, I instantly knew that I want to try out to achieve that with CSS. Disclaimer: [browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=view-timeline) is not there yet. While we are waiting for other broswers to catch up, you can use [polyfill](https://github.com/flackr/scroll-timeline)

```javascript

@keyframes reveal {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0%) scale(1);
  }
}

.slide-in {
  /* Create View Timeline */
  view-timeline-name: --revealing-image;
  view-timeline-axis: block;

  /* Attach animation, linked to the  View Timeline */
  animation: ease-in-out reveal both;
  animation-timeline: --revealing-image;

  /* Tweak range when effect should run*/
  animation-range: entry 25% cover 30%;
}
```

## Slide in example with CSS vs JS

{/* <ImageSlideExample /> */}

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 sm:gap-12">
  <image-slide-in variant="CSS"></image-slide-in>
  <image-slide-in variant="JS"></image-slide-in>
</div>
